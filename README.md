1. The computer will automatically pick a boys name at random.

2. the user starts the game by selecting a letter on the keyboard.

3. The computer will check to see if the user's choice matches any of the letters in the name it chose.

4. The user has 10 guesses in total. If a letter chosen matches a letter in the name, the users letter will appear in the blank spaces that the letter is located. If no match, no letters appear.

5. If all the letters appear before all 10 guesses are used, the user wins and populates in the win counter.

6. If the user runs out of guesses, the user loses and populates in the loss counter.
